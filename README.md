# pdfbox_tessaract_pdf_to_text
converts a flat pdf to text (pdf -> image -> text)

Import as an existing maven project
add all libraries in the libs folder to your build path
You can set varying dpi for the image based on what works for you. I've observed that the translation get better with increasing dpi. However, the size of the image file also increases with it.
